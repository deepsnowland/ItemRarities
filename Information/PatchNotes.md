## vX.X.X:

>**Note:** A bundle of ideas, with no guarantee of implementation.

- JSON Enhancements
	- Don't embed the `.json` files.
		- Doing this allows for fancier `.json` code.
		- Or switch to asynchronous loading for the `.json`'s.
	- Overall, should allow for quicker loading - and less errors. Suggested by [**The Illusion**](https://github.com/Arkhorse).
- Compatibility
	- Support for other modifications which have custom items.
		- Create separate `.json`'s for each external mod and set rarities.
	- Implement a custom API system for easier integration.
- Customization
    - Give players the ability to change the colours of each rarity label using `ModSettings`.
    	- Some sort of display showing the differences in colour?
- Inventory
	- Add the ability to filter by rarity. From lowest `Common` to highest `Mythic`.'
	- Add a small icon in each Inventory Grid item to show the rarity without clicking on the item.
- Visual Enhancements
	- Introduce different visual effects or glows for different rarity levels.
		- For example, a pulsating glow for mythic items - or the label displaying on the screen once found.
	- When an item is hovered over on the ground, display a visual for the rarity type before inspecting or picking up.
		- Can either do this through an icon or the label itself. Suggested by **RossBondReturns**.
- Modification Rewrite (v2.0.0)
	- Switch from a instanced `UILabel` system to a standalone `UILabel` system.
		- This allows for easier implementation amongst other harmony patches.
		- Allows for values of the `UILabel` to be changed in one place, which updates across all.
		- May improve performance and eliminate any incompatibilities.
		- Will help the mod be future-proof to all upcoming updates.
	- Switch to an automatic rarity-based system. Suggested by [**Digitalzombie**](https://github.com/DigitalzombieTLD/).
		- Will be less time consuming, and will support all external modifications automatically. 
		- Could do this through spawn rates of each item in certain regions using the `GearSpawner` mod. 
		- Creating methods which get values for specific items like clothing, food may be a possibility.

## v1.1.2:

> Released on the **12th of October 2023**.

### Highlights / Key Changes:
- Merged pull request [**#4**](https://github.com/Deaadman/ItemRarities/pull/4), potentially fixing many issues, specifically issue [**#7**](https://github.com/Deaadman/ItemRarities/issues/7).
- Updated for The Long Dark v2.24.

- Changed the location of the `HashSet` from the `Panel_ActionsRadial` patch to the `ItemRarities.cs` file.
<br></br>

### Acknowledgements:
- [**The Illusion**](https://github.com/Arkhorse) - For opening pull request [**#4**](https://github.com/Deaadman/ItemRarities/pull/4) and fixing many issues.

- Changed many explicit type declarations with `var`.
- Changed `ContainsKey` to `TryGetValue` in the `GetRarity()` method, for a more efficient lookup in the dictionary.
- Changed `Enum.Parse()` method to `Enum.TryParse()` for the ability to add error handling.

- Fixed `'using' statement can be simplified` warning under the `GetEmbeddedResource()` method.
- Fixed `Use 'switch' expression` warning in the `GetColorForRarity()` method.
- Fixed `Converting null literal or possible null value to non-nullable type` warning by adding a `?` in front of `Stream` - so it is now `Stream?`.
